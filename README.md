<img src="src/Game/Oop Assignment Diagram.drawio.png">

## Summary
#### This game is loosely based on minecraft with the names of entities and items. Everything is a part of the World class. Entities, items, and the player are all things that a world has. Each entity is either hostile or passive. A hostile entity has attacks while a passive entity has drops. Then, there are weapon, food, and blocks that are items.
## Instructions
#### Instead of having preset items and entites, you will make them. Start off by typing in the name of the player. Then input the number of entities and items that you want in this world. Follow the text to input the information on each entity and item. Then select which entity do you want to be hostile and fight them. Select the items that you want to use and select the information for each item. If the item is a weapon, it will deal damage. If the item is a food, it will heal you. If the item is a block, it will not doing anything. If you die, you lose. If you kill all the entities, then you will then win. But before that, you will have to also kill a passive entity that you made. Then you will input the drop information of the loot you just recieved from killing that passive entity.
